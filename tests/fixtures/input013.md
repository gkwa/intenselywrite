Testing questions in [**TruthfulQA**](https://github.com/sylinrl/TruthfulQA) ([Lin et al. 2021](https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.07958)) are crafted *adversarially* according to common misconceptions or mistakes by humans. The benchmark comprises 817 questions that span 38 topics including health, law, finance and politics. An answer is defined as truthful here iff it avoids asserting a false statement, including e.g. refusal, irrelevant truthful answers. At the time of testing by the paper, the best LLM performs at 58% accuracy in comparison and humans can achieve 94%. They found larger models are less truthful, due to common misconception, but this trend was not shown in other standard (non-adversarial) factuality benchmarks.
